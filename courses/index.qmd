### Fundamentals

These are courses which are not specific to any programming language. They are useful skills to have regardless of the language you are using.

---

### Python

Python is a versatile programming language. In research it is often used for simulation, machine learning, and building data pipelines.

:::

---

### R

R is a programming language most often used for statistics. It has great libraries for data manipulation and visualisation.

### Software engineering

Any code you write for research should be maintainable, although we don't think everyone needs to be a software engineer to be a good researcher. These courses can equip you with the skills to write more robust, reusable, and reproducible code.

### High performance computing (HPC)

HPC is the use of computer clusters (also known as supercomputers) to solve advanced computation problems. These facilities allow you to queue processing jobs on machines that have large amounts of storage, memory or processing power.
