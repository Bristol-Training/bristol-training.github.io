    Reproducible programming environments are crucial for ensuring consistent and reliable software development.
    They enable developers to recreate exact configurations, facilitating collaboration and long-term maintenance of projects.
    Watch a demonstration of uv (a new environment management tool for Python) and how as a data scientist, research software engineer or scientific coder, you might take practical steps to incorporate this into your project.
    This talk will be of interest to people that use pip or conda to install packages for their Python project.

    Git is a version control system that allows you to save multiple versions of a file or directory.
    This is useful to allow you to keep a record of all changes made to a file, and to move backwards and forwards in time through different versions of your file.
    GitHub uses Git providing a web-based interface for managing Git repositories and allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously.
