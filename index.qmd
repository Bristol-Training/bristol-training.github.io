These courses can be self-led, but are also taught throughout the year. Our **training alerts mailing list** sends updates on when we are teaching the courses.

## Fundamentals courses

These are courses which are not specific to any programming language. They are useful skills to have regardless of the language you are using.

## Python courses

Python is a versatile programming language. In research it is often used for simulation, machine learning, and building data pipelines.

:::{#python-courses}
:::

## R courses

R is a programming language most often used for statistics. It has great libraries for data manipulation and visualisation.

## Software engineering courses

Any code you write for research should be maintainable, although we don't think everyone needs to be a software engineer to be a good researcher. These courses can equip you with the skills to write more robust, reusable, and reproducible code.

## Credits

These courses are maintained and delivered by the team at the University of Bristol's [Jean Golding Institute](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/golding/) and the [Advanced Computing Research Centre](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/).

Many of the courses were developed by members of the University of Bristol's Research Software Engineering group, with special thanks to Christopher Woods, Matt Williams and Al Tanner.
