#  Data Science and Research Software Engineering Training 
**Training in data science, research software engineering and data engineering from the University of Bristol.**

All the courses listed take approximately 3 hours to complete.
Courses can be self-led, but are also taught throughout the year.
For information on upcoming courses, please subscribe to our mailing
list (to be developed...)

## Fundamentals

These are courses which are not specific to
any programming language. They are useful skills 
to have regardless of the language you are using.

:::{#fundamentals}

## Python Courses

Python is a versatile language. In 
research it is often used for simulation,
machine learning, and building data pipelines.



:::{#python-courses}
:::

## R Courses
R is a program most often used for 
statistics. It has great libraries 
for data manipulation and visualisation.

:::{#r-courses}
:::

## Software Engineering
Any code you write for research should be maintainable,
although we don't think everyone needs to be a software 
engineer to be a good researcher. These courses can equip
you with the skills to write more robust, reusable, and 
reproducible code.

## Credits 

All of these courses were developed by members
of the University of Bristol's Research Software Engineering
group, based in the Advanced Computing Research Centre (ACRC).

The course is now being maintained and delivered by the 
team at the University of Bristol's Jean Golding Institute.

Credits for each course can be found in the course
materials, but a special thanks to:

* Christopher Woods
* Matt Williams
* Allee Tanner
